# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately. Do not create a public issue. You can contact the maintainers at [Github Autobot](mailto:Autobot@gatekeepersystem.com) or through the organization's security reporting process.

We will respond as quickly as possible and keep you updated on the status of your report.
